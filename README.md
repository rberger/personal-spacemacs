# Personal spacemacs config

## Install

This will replace your ~/.spacemacs and ~/.spacemacs.d on your computer[s]

You should first make sure you installed [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org):

Move (and eventually remove) your old ~/.emacs.d if you were not already using spacemacs.

```
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Then:

```
git clone https://github.com/rberger/personal-spacemacs ~/.spacemacs.d
```
